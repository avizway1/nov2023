NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.


ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
 On-demand self-service : 
 Broad network access & High Availability : 
 Resource pooling. :
 Rapid elasticity. : 
 Measured Services. : 
 
===========================================


7:30 Am IST to 8:30/45 AM IST.. 

S3 : AWS version of google Drive : 
99.99 % Availability
99.999999999 % durability (11 9's)

ec2 : Place where we can run our servers. 

server..??? 

t2.nano	 : 1 vcpu, 0.5 memory/RAM
t2.large : 2 cpu, 8 gb ram


======================================

DEPLOYMENT MODELS :

Public cloud   :  Open for everyone.. Main: Service provider takes care..  AWS, Azure, GCP….

Private cloud  : Not open for all, Dedicated to one organisation..  Main: you can fix issues / get assistance from 3rd party.. 

Hybrid cloud : Combination of multiple deployment options.. (aws+azure / AWS + Our existing office network)
We have used AWS Direct Connect..  jio/Sify/Airtel

Community cloud : Group of organisation build and use DC. 


==================================

Service Models of CC: 

SaaS : Software as a Service : 
PaaS : platform as a Service : 
IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service : 

On-Premise : 

Demo : Deliver a website using Service models of CC.

MFA : MultiFactor Authentication : Additional level of security for our login process.

IAM : Identity and access management : We can create users, groups and we can manage user access on aws account.

IAM user with AdministratorAccess = root user - account/billing management


Root user : Unrestricted access on AWS account. 
IAM user : Identity and access management : 


Requirement : Need a user who can manage only s3 service.!!!


Password policy : We can enforce all IAM users to maintain specified standards while setting their own passwords.


Task 1 : Create an AWS account and enable MFA.

Task 2 : Setup password policy and creqate alias for your aws account.

Task 3 : Create an IAM user and allocate him "S3FullAccess", now login as this user and create and delete a bucket.

=========================================================================


Password policy : We can enforce all IAM users to maintain specified standards while setting their own passwords.

___________________________________

root user : unrestricted access on aws env.. : Dont use this for day to day activities.. 

Least privilages mechanism : provide only required permissions to perform his job.


Step 1 : provide username : "S3_Admin"
Access type; Console Access.. Password and Sign-in URL

Step 2 ; provide required permissions.

Groups : Create a group, add permissions at group level and add this user to group.
COpy permissions from another user : 
Attach permissions directly : 

Step 3: review and create user. 


IAM user with Administrator Access = same as root user without account management permissions.


Requirement : I need an IAM user, He should have full access on AWS account, but no access on S3 Service.


Policy : Set of Permissions on our aws account. Policy writtens in JSON format.
--> AWS Managed - Job Function
--> AWS Managed Policy
--> Customer Managed Policy
__________________

Policy : Document contains set of permissions writtens in JSON format. Policy provide permissions on AWS resources for users/groups/roles.


--> AWS Managed Policy : Policy provided by AWS, Based on Service.
--> AWS managed - Job function policy : policy provided by AWS, It is a combination of multiple Services. AWS provided this based on some standard jobs available in market.
--> Customer Managed policy : 


Task : Create a policy to deny s3.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, provide him "AdministratorAccess" and associate "task 1 policy" to this user, login and try to create a bucket.!!! 


For Task 3 create a new IAM user and associate the poliocy you are creating as part of Task 3.
Task 3 : Create a Policy to allow S3FullACcess, but this should work from only one/your Network.
** You have to add an IP address condition.

https://whatismyipaddress.com/
60.243.230.180/32

Task 4 : Create an IAM user, provide him "AdministratorAccess", Use this user throughout the course.
Provide him "Billing access".


=========================================================================


ARN : Amazon Resource Name : A unique identifier for our resources.

Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource. Hard to track this, Only in special occassions we use this inline policy.

CloudTrail : Logging service in AWS. It logs everything (including refresh also).
--> Enabled by default. We dont have option disable it. 
--> Defaultly it can store last 90 days logs.


Credential report : It gives all IAM users last logged in, pwd expiration, creation data and accesskeys..


policy sumulator : 



Task  : Create a custom policy to activate MFA for IAM users, He himself able to activate MFA. 
	Create an IAM user, provide S3FullAccess. Login as this user and Now try to "Activate MFA". It will give error. Fix this errors and allow him to activate MFA.


Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Want to provide "S3FullAccess" with our custom policy,  We need to restrict this user to work only on specific region (mumbai/ap-south-1).

Create a policy allow all s3 actions on all resources, Add a "region" condition.

==> Login as this user, Try to create bucket in "mumbai" it should allow. If you choose any other regions it should not allow.
